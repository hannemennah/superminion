The tmp-### files are the frames of a .gif of a gently dilating white circle on a black background. 

These image frames are looped through in the main Tkinter loop, for a soothing effect.

It also has the nice bonus of signaling when the application is actually crunching numbers (as opposed to just paused and idle).

The rest of the images are the icons for the buttons of superminion.
